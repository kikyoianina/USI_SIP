Data downloaded via the 'Build A Table' function of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Environment and Health Data Portal is currently separated into two linked data files, Data.csv and SourceInformation.csv.

Data.csv contains actual data values along with relevant information on the associated Geography, Year, Measure Type, and subject matter. The 'Indicator_ID' field designates a code number for unique subject matter, that can be joined to the source information in the other file. Many records in the Data file may be associated with a single source in the SourceInformation file.

SourceInformation.csv provides metadata describing the data in the first file with the matching value in the 'Indicator_ID' field. 

Geography notes: please see the explanatory pdf document at http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/tracking/neighborhoods.pdf to see definitions of NYC neighborhood groupings used on this portal. For mapping purposes, download shapefiles or geoJSON files containing portal geographies on the lower right corner of the 'Build A Table' page.
